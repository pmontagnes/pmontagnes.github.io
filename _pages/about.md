title: "I'm an Associate Professor of Political Science and Data & Decision Sciences at Emory University. My research lies in political economy, with a focus on how institutions shape accountability, selection, and regulatory design. I use formal theory and applied microeconometrics to study elections and ideology, courts, lobbying and information, bureaucracy and rules versus discretion, and organizational economics (including internal talent markets). My work appears in journals such as the American Economic Review, American Political Science Review, Journal of Public Economics, Journal of Politics, Management Science, and PNAS."
