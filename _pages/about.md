<div style="font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.4em;">
Iâ€™m an Associate Professor of Data & Decision Sciences and Political Science at Emory University. My research lies in political economy, with a focus on how institutions, algorithms, and incentives shape accountability, selection, behavior, and regulatory design. I use formal theory and applied microeconometrics to study elections and ideology, courts, lobbying and information, bureaucracy and the balance between rules and discretion, and the organizational economics and governance of firms and public institutions. My work appears in journals such as the American Economic Review, American Political Science Review, Journal of Public Economics, Journal of Politics, Management Science, and PNAS.
